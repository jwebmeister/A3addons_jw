# CFPconfig_jw

ArmA 3 addon. JWebmeister's config tweaks of CFP.
- Modified loadout of certain faction (Taliban, Boko Haram) AT units, equipped them with a TBG-7V (increases the likelihood of RPG-7 use against infantry, if CUP config tweaks are loaded).
- Fixed loadout of Taliban AA unit, it had the FIM-92F Stinger but not the magazine.
