# CFPconfig_jw

ArmA 3 addon. JWebmeister's config tweaks of CFP.
- Modified loadout of certain factions infantry AT units, equipped them with a TBG-7V (increases the likelihood of RPG-7 use against infantry, if CUP config tweaks are loaded).
- Fixed loadout of infantry AA units, re-enabling AI's ability to fire the FIM-92 Stinger. They had the FIM-92F Stinger but not its magazine.
